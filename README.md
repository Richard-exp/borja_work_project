Let`s do it together!:)

### 1. Power:
   - Works with three 18650 batteries (10V - total output voltage), that have to be regulalry charged.
   - 9V battery is not enought for 2 motors (rotates only in one direction, fastly discharges and therefore slows down after some time).

### 2. Robot`s components:
   - Microcontroller - Arduino Uno
   - Motor driver - SBX; H-bridge
   - Arduino Sensor Shield
   - DC motors
   - Accumulator - three 18650 batteries
   - Converter from accumulator to microcontroller and motor driver - 7805ACT RAHA11 G
   - Ultrasonic sensor - Arduino Sonar sensor
